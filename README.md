# AI-agent
An AI agent built with Python is like your smart, digital assistant that handles tasks for you. You give it a goal, and it figures out the steps and even uses tools (like accessing information online or your company's systems) to get it done. Think of it as a proactive helper that learns and gets better at its job over time, freeing you up for more important things.
